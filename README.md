## Ready Bounties
To find bounty-tagged tasks that are ready to claim, look at the [Bounty Tasks Kanban board](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bounties/projects/1). Any tasks with the `Ready` label and in the `Backlog` column, are open and can be claimed by anyone.

To claim the bounty, you must first state your intention on the [PSF Telegram Channel](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bounties/issues/7). PSF management will assess your skills and history. If you are approved to work on a bounty, the bounty will be tagged with your name. This process ensures that bounties are accomplished in a reasonable time frame and are well matched to a developers skill set. It also provides a chance for senior developers to mentor junior developers.
